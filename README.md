# Battle Bots
**Still in development*
### About
Battle Bots is a real-time strategy game in which the player controls a team of bots to coordinate attacks against enemy teams. The bots use a priority-based finite-state machine (FSM) as their AI. There are currently 8 unique bot types and 4 unique structure types. 

### Details
- **Language**: Swift  
- **Framework**: SpriteKit  
- **Devices**: iPhone 5s and 6  
- **Target**: iOS 8  

### Gameplay
Each team has a **Headquarters** that they must protect while simultaneously trying to destroy the HQ of enemy teams. Teams also possess at least one **Repair Station** and one **Charging Station**. Repair stations can heal/repair damaged bots. Bots need to have power to operate, so they must make regular stops at a Charging Station to recharge. In order to build bots, teams need to gather ore from nearby repositories.
The player commands their bots by selecting one or more at a time and tapping to mark a destination or target.

### Controls
Movement:  
- Quick swipe to move around map.  
- Quick tap near a bot to keep that bot centered in the view.  
- Quick tap (not near a bot) to center a certain location in the view. 
 
Selection:
